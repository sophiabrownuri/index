  <p> As a student of Journalism and International Relations, I am interested in the relationship between one person’s actions and their effect on other people in other places – that same day or hundreds of years later. My goal is to tell extended stories of these connections through in-depth data stories.</p>
  <p> In addition to my work in journalism, I make and design historical and fantasy based clothing for myself and others. I am also the violinist for the Waytes of Carolingia, a local medieval dance band.</p>
